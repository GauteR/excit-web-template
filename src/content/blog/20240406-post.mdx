This is a sample post to show how the blog posts will look.

In the configuration, on top of the file, you can see the title, description, pubDate and heroImage. The heroImage is the image that will be shown on the front page of the post.

The content of the post is written in markdown and can contain images, links, code snippets and more.

```js
const example = 'This is a code snippet';
console.log(example);
```

This is a link to [Google](https://www.google.com).

This is an image:
![About](/about.webp)

The blog posts are sorted by the pubDate, so the newest post will be shown first.
