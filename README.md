## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of this project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
|   â””â”€â”€ styles/
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

And some other server related files.

The server looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## Usage

Edit `package.json` to use `your-module-name`, instead of `excit-web-template`.

Edit `src/consts.ts` to your liking.

To create a new blog post, simply create a new .mdx-file in the `src/content/blog` folder. When you compile the new code (locally, staging or live), it will automatically load the new MDX and create a page out of it.

To change the header links, edit the `src/components/Header.astro` file, specifically the HeaderLink attributes found in the internal-links class.

To build for prod: `docker build . -t your-module-name` and use the docker-image to create a container that can run on a web-host, or run `npm run build` and put the files generated in the `dist/` folder on the web-host that you plan to use. See the `docker-compose.yml` for an example on how to set up the image on your server.
